This is Australia's Cairns map.

The map have a lot of letter,some park name and maybe train's line.

I want to travel Australia so I chose the map.
And I want to see koalas , Cairns have some zoo
can hold koalas !

Good point...
The map use a lot of color so it is interesting.
Having a lot of letter show us there have many sightseen.

Not good point...
I think the map have more space during the letter
because some letter be too close.
